I started my journey in Graphic Design and there I realized that I loved creating visuals that told a story. I started getting curious about web design and how design could interact with users. It was really cool to see how visuals and functionality come together on a website. That curiosity quickly turned into a new focus for me. Now I’m diving into web design as a student, learning all the technical stuff like HTML, CSS, and how to make things look good and work well and I am excited to keep building and creating things people can actually use.

My friends thankfully also like to dance so that's always fun. I recently just started learning to play guitar this summer so I still don't sound the best but&nbsp; hopefully I'll improve my skills with more practice! Doing all these things make me happy so I try to do them whenever I can.

My goal is to become a full-stack designer. I'm &nbsp;especially interested in working on projects that challenge me to think both creatively and analytically.
